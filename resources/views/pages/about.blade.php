                        <p>Chisankho 2019 is a digital platform that displays electoral conflict early warning and response
                        data as is collected first hand and almost in real time by a network of over 70 monitors spread in
                        13 electoral conflict prone districts throughout Malawi. The 13 districts are Nsanje, Chikwawa,
                        Rumphi, Karonga, Lilongwe, Salima, Mulanje, Zomba, Mangochi, Mwanza, Chiradzulu,
                        Blantyre and Kasungu.</p>
                        <p>The platform is a core component of the International Foundation for Electoral System’s (IFES)
                        Malawi Electoral Integrity Program (MEIP), supported by USAID and DFID. Through this
                        program, IFES is running a conflict Early Warning Early Response (EWER) program that entails
                        supporting six civil society organizations (CCSOs) and their network of monitors to collect
                        electoral conflict early warning data in the13 districts and intervene to manage electoral conflicts
                        primarily through the district Multi-Party Liaison Committee (MPLCs) structures. The six CSOs
                        are Youth and Society (YAS); International Group Association (IGA) Malawi; National
                        Elections Systems Trust (NEST); Tiphedzane Community Support (TICOSO) and Catholic
                        Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) Chikwawa Diocese and the National Office of CCJP
                        as well.</p>
                        <p>The early warning data and subsequent mitigative interventions are displayed on the Chisankho
                        2019 digital platform. The aim is to present to the public and duty bearers including the Malawi
                        National Police Service, Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC), National Election Consultative
                        Forum (NECOF), media and other actors with reliable data and evidence on the electoral conflict
                        dynamics in the 13 districts so that where necessary, these stakeholders can use the data for
                        further interventions or for documentation and knowledge purposes.</p>
                        <p>Data to the platform is primarily sent by the network of monitors through the CSOs. However, in
                        case citizens witness cases of interest in their respective districts, they are encouraged to reach
                        out either to the monitors, the CSOs or the respective MPLC members. These actors will verify
                        and send the early warning indicators as soon as possible to the platform.</p>
